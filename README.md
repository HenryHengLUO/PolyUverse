# PolyUverse Project 🎓🎉🌍

Welcome to the PolyUverse project! 🎉✨🌟

## Project Overview 📝

The PolyUverse is a metaverse created to celebrate the 85th Anniversary of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2022. 🎉🎓🎈

Due to the border control measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many alumni were unable to attend the in-person celebration event. To bridge this gap, the PolyUverse provides a virtual space for all alumni to come together and celebrate online. 🌐💻🎊

In the PolyUverse, you can:

- Write down your name and words of blessings to the university, expressing your love and support. 💬✍️❤️
- Remember the name of the university president during your time at the university, honoring their contributions. 🏛️👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
